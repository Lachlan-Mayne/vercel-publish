Business 2023

Role of operations management

-       Operations refers to the coordination of those activities in a business that are involved in combining inputs for the purpose of producing an output that is valued by consumers.

-       Known as value adding.

-       Operations management is to ensure a smooth production process that contributes to the output of goods and services of an organisation.

Strategic role of operations management

-       To ensure that the goals of the organisation are met.

-       Generally, it revolves around profit maximisation which is achieved though maximising revenue and minimising costs.

-       Cost leadership is working towards being the lowest cost manufacturer in the industry.

-       By reducing the costs of production and distribution, a business will be able to gain an advantage over competitors.

Operations function

-       Input costs

-       Labour costs

-       Processing costs

-       Inventory costs

-       Quality management costs

Economies of scale

-       Increase in production while using the same production facilities.

-       The cost advantages companies gain from increasing their output.

Product differentiation

-       Distinguishing products (goods or services)

-       This can be achieved through companies changing obvious aspects of their product such as quality, price, application, etc.

-       Deodorant – many brands, different application methods, price, chemical makeup, price, different target market, 

-       Varying the actual product features

-       Varying product quality

-       Varying and augmented features

Goods and/or services in different businesses

-       The operations function will look different in different businesses depending on their industry category.

-       Businesses that provide tangible products to customers are known as goods.

-       Businesses supplying intangible products to customers are known as services.

Operations management in relation to a bank can include the idea of cost differentiation, this can be achieved through banks being able to potentially introduce exclusive memberships affiliated with the bank.

Operations management in relation to a bank can include the idea of coast leadership, this can be achieve through banks being able to potentially offer a range of plans available to customers.

The strategic role of operations management could assist the business through being able to change the way that the business operates in order to change their products to make them more appealing to the target audience.

Quality expectations

-       Products ability to satisfy stated or implied needs.

What would be the implications for a business that failed to meet quality expectations,

Apple:

1.     A higher quality would result in a higher price being charged, potentially with an increase in features that would come with quality. Vice versa with a lower quality product, customers would expect a cheaper price for a product that is regarded as low quality or lower quality.

2.     If Apple failed to meet quality expectations, customers would question the business’ decision to not follow through and improve their previous model.

3.     If Apple did meet the quality expectations, customers probably would be pleasantly surprised potentially, and possibly looking forward to the next model that is to succeed the product in question.

Happy repeat purchase of next model gain customers increase revenue profit.

What would you suggest Qantas Operations Management need to focus on in the next 12 months?

Government policies:

-       Government policies.

-       Can change because of a change in government or a change in social expectations.

-       Major influence on operations because all businesses operate in a legal/political environment.

-       Political decisions

-       affect rules and regulations that a business must follow, which changes the function, specifically operations. 

-       It is important that business are aware and up to date with policies as they can lead to law making, (they may have legal consequences for businesses) but it also might lead to new business opportunities.

o   Fuel industry moves towards bends of 90% of unleaded petrol and 10% ethanol fuel. influences car makers and fuel manufacturers and also sugar cane and grain industries.

o   Sometimes the Australian government regards a product or process as undesirable and reduces the demand for the product.

-       Qantas (COVID).

o   During pandemic Qantas retired their 747 models, thus grounding around 100 aircraft including most of their international fleet for up to 12 months.

o   Put all their A380’s into storage. deferred deliveries of new planes huge impact on operations as a result of Government COVID-19 policy.

o   Taking care of grounded planes impacted what operations did very expensive.

o   Qantas now need to remove and throw away pillows and headphones.

o   Qantas is now saving money by making more customer independence: checking in, etc.

o   Fair work act (2009) ^ prices for operations.

o   Qantas needs a flexible operations management because Government policies are not always fixed for long periods.

Environmental sustainability

-       Concerned with air, water, waste and environmentally sustainable products and operations practices.

-       As the community becomes more aware of the need for environmental sustainability, business’ need to become more responsible for their impact.

-       Customers are looking for businesses to make a more proactive approach to environmental impacts.

-       Examples of negative impacts:

o   Wastewater altering the natural water cycle.

o   Food wastage methane production.

o   Pollution emissions.

o   Packaging rubbish build up.

o   Carbon emissions business’ emission levels are significantly higher than the individual household.

-       Examples of positive responses:

o   Using reclaimed rubbish for inputs replacing single use plastic.

o   Electric power alternative transport.

o   Food banks finding alternatives to increasing food waste.

Qantas & Environmental Sustainability

-       Airline industry have a massive carbon footprint.

-       Qantas’ response:

o   Reach net zero emissions by 2050, which is very ambitious.

o   Committing $50 million over the next 10 years towards development of a sustainable aviation fuel industry.

o   Committing to zero single use plastics by 2027.

o   New tri-generation power plant in Sydney for electricity use.

o   Using recycled water to wash planes.

Assess the influence of environmental sustainability on operations management at Qantas.

-       Waste reduction:

o   Qantas want to try to continue working with their suppliers in order to make the food wastage lower by looking at alternatives.

o   Removing single use plastic in both their supply chain and operations.

o   Developing an offshore operation which will be 100% free of landfill by 2030.

-       Sustainable aviation fuel, Qantas’ approach:

o   To make efforts to develop a sustainable fuel that can be used for aviation and not produce a currently large carbon footprint.

-       The operations management at Qantas have been visibly impacted by environmental sustainability.

Qantas have said that they aim to reduce emissions significantly by 2030 and have also designated large sums of money to developing a sustainable aviation fuel industry. Qantas have begun removing single use plastic in both their supply chain and operations as well as working with their suppliers in efforts to reduce food wastage. This has impacted their inputs and planning and transformation processes as they need to become more aware of their role in environmental sustainability.

Processes:

Inputs at Qantas:

Transformed:

-       Materials – fossil fuel (raw), food for catering, paper, and computers (intermediate).

-       Information – gov. statistics, market, and industry reports.

-       Customers – transformed by transportation from one location to another.

Transforming:

-       Human resources – everyone from the cleaners and baggage handlers to the pilots and sales managers.

-       Facilities/capital – terminal buildings and their contents, maintenance facilities, spare parts holdings, etc.

Four V’s

-       Volume: how much of a product is made

-       Variety: the range of products made

-       Variation on demand: the amount of a product desired by consumers

-       Visibility: the nature and amount of customers contact (feedback)

Textbook

4.     List three businesses that are increasing sales volumes in Australia.

Zara, Uniqlo, H&M

5.     How does variation in demand affect the volume of product brought to the market by Zara, Uniqlo and H&M?

It is referred to as seasonal items in fashion. This is then broken down into smaller cycles. Resulting in new designs six times a year instead of two to four times a year.

6.     What is the importance of visibility to clothing retailers?

Store locations are placed in highly visible areas in maximise the possibility of passing trade. This can be achieved through large shopping centres alongside a strong social media presence.

9. Identify the brands manufactured by Electrolux.

Electrolux, AEG-Electrolux, Simpson, Chef, Dishlex, Kelvinator and Westinghouse brands.

10. Account for why, while there may be wide range of products, the processes remain narrow.

The reason for why the wide range of products is still narrow in terms of processes, many of the brands are electronically similar. Resulting in Electrolux not needing to diversify their production process often to match their products and brands.

Sequencing and Scheduling

-       Sequencing refers to the order in which activities in the operations process occur.

-       Scheduling refers to the order in which activities in the operation process are planned.

Gantt charts and Critical Path Analysis

Gantt charts:

-       Good for collaborating with a large team.

-       Outlines order of activities and duration of activity.

-       Good for processes with multiples steps.

-       Advantages,

o   Forces a manager to plan the steps needed to complete tasks and specify the time required.

o   Makes it easier to monitor actual progress against planned activities.

Critical Path Analysis:

Analyse the use of sequencing and scheduling to improve business goals to improve business operations.

Sequencing and scheduling are both useful for improving business operations through how they can be applied in order to make operations run smoother.

Sequencing can help with ordering activities within the business particularly in the transformation process.

Scheduling can be used to give each activity a length of time within the transformation process for a business, therefore meaning that they can work together to put business activities into an orderly plan with their respective durations coinciding to make the business plan run smoothly. Inherently improving business operations.

Explain 2 factors that North coast should consider when planning the layout of their new factory.

North Coast Manufacturing should consider the idea that there should be little distance between their transport dock and the production line. This results in a smaller amount of distance the products need to cover during the process making for a faster production time and allow for a smaller chance for damage and waste of semi-finished products as they move around the facility.

North Coast Manufacturing might also benefit from considering

Transformation process.

Monitoring, controlling, improving.

Monitoring:

-       Measuring actual performance against planned performance.

-       KPI’s are used often to monitor performance.

Controlling:

-       Compares what was intended to happen with what actually happened and taking corrective action.

Improvement:

-       Being intentional about making the changes to the transformation process in order to have a preferred outcome.

-       Focuses on:

o   Time

o   Process flow

o   Quality

o   Cost

o   Efficiency

North Coast Manufacturing could monitor the effectiveness of their new factory layout by setting individual KPI’s for the speed that the factory could output a piece of furniture.

They could then compare current and previous figures to keep track of any improvement while looking at how they can improve for the new KPI.

New product or service design & development
- identifying a market opportunity.
- Creating a product.
- Testing and modifying the product. 
Businesses do this to gain or maintain competitive advantages. Satisfy the needs of existing customers and/or attempt to sell to new customers. 

Development
-  Screening of ideas as well as identifying the commercial aspects. (marketing and product launch and forecasting.)
Design
- Selecting materials and processes and engineering product as well as product's mechanical make up to make sure it works before production. 

Supply chain management 
- important because new products will draw from suppliers and may extend the range or supplies, etc. 

Quality
- because in market-oriented production, the customers will demand particular quality, and certain attributes and features. 

Capacity of the business
- a new product may increase the use or range of present resources. 

Cost
- can be determined from the amount of inputs, time and energy used in processing the new products. 

Specifics
- Explicit service
- Implicit service
- Use of goods


Supply chain management
- managing the chain of supplies
	- supply chain management involves figuring out and managing the flow of supplies though inputs, transformation processes and outputs. 
- three key aspects
	- logistics
	- e-commerce
	- global sourcing

Logistics
- All about managing the flow of materials, info and other resources between supply and consumption. 
- logistics refers to distribution and also includes; transportation, use of storage and material handling and packaging. 
- distribution refers to the ways of getting the goods or services to the customer. 

Transportation
- relates to the physical movement of inventories.
	- storage involves finding a secure place to hold stock 
	- warehousing is the use of a facility for storage, protection and distribution of stock
	- distribution centre is not intended for log term storage, it is strategically placed for convenience to minimise time taken for stock to travel to outlets. 

Material handling and packaging
- involves choosing the appropriate methods for the goods or services involved. 
	- Eg: glassware, dangerous chemicals

b) Is supply chain management important to Casey's business? Justify your answer.

Supply chain management is important to Casey as stock for the business is affected. Casey should prioritise looking for cheaper suppliers to keep costs down and maximise profits.


Outsourcing 13/11

- use of external third party providers to perform business activities for a business. 



Technology 15/11
- the use of technology leads to the business being able to obtain competitive advantages.
- businesses can chose between leading edge technology or established technology.
	- leading edge technology is the most advanced or innovative at any point in time. 
	- established technology is what is already in in use and is accepted without question, it may not lead to a competitive advantages as it is commonly used, but if business do not use them, they may be at a disadvantage. 


Textbook questions pg 133, 4-8
4. The alternative term used for "leading edge technology" is known as "cutting edge technology"
5. Finetech and robo-advisor algorithms are used by businesses to help customers with their financial and investment decisions through algorithms that use the customers risk preferences, volume of investment, etc. 
6. Benefits of robo-advisors:
	1. accurate and specific advice,
	2. available 24hrs 7 days a week
	3. reduces legal complications from financial advice and make the suggestions more individualised for customers. 
7. Innovation and technology are related because technology is an aspect of business that is constantly changing over time and will continue to change and adapt. Innovative new ideas can be expressed through the advancement of technology as well. 
8. 4 forms of established technology
	1. Flexible management systems (FMS) in regards to the transformation process. 
	2. Barcoding and Point of Sale (POS) data 
	3. Computer aided design (CAD)
	4. Information processing technology and information technology (IT)

Qantas Activities
1. Established technology and leading edge technology can be applied to Qantas through their planes being leading edge and their call centres being established technology areas. The differences can be seen through the prioritisation having the best and latest planes while keeping a consistent customer service through their call centres. 
2. 4 forms of established technology
	1. call centres
	2. Barcodes for baggage
	3. baggage scanning technology
	4. self check in tech
	4 forms of leading edge technology
	1. planes used
	2. bio fuel
	3. flight planning technology
3. benefits of using established technology at Qantas is to make the customer experience more consistent between airline brands, such as checking in and security checks not being overly unique to Qantas .
4. Qantas are using leading edge technology through their desire to use the latest plane models that are the most fuel efficient and can fly the longest distances, this is to keep the customer experience during the flight a step ahead of the competition. Almost in the efforts to make the Qantas experience unique.


Inventory management
- Inventory or stock refers to the amount of raw materials, work-in progress and finished goods that a business has on hand at any particular point in time.
- Holding stock refers to a business keeping stock in storage or available for sale, rather than having to order it or create it as needed. 
- There are disadvantages and advantages of holding stock. 


A fruit shop can use inventory management methods such as FIFO (first in first out). This can prove to be an advantage for this business because it allows for stock to be managed easier because there won't be a possibility of over stocking as the older stock is distributed once ordered. 

Quality management at Qantas.

- quality control
	- Inspections are carried out at key stages to make sure the process is meeting the specified standards. 
- quality assurance
	- Monitor level of quality at all stages by measurement against standards. Focus having good procedures. 
- quality improvement
	- Invite staff to participate in brainstorming ideas and suggestions to improve quality, attempts to make quality both central and strategic within Qantas. 

The truck repair business can use quality control and quality assurance. The business could benefit form using quality control through consistent inspections into the processes they use when repairing vehicles. This means that the business can keep the quality consistent for all their repairs, especially if the inspections can remove defects in the process. The truck repair business could also consider the use of quality assurance, this can be achieved through comparing their results from their services to the national standards for vehicle repair. They could also investigate their competitors to gain insight into what similar companies output and try and aim to improve their own services. This way, the business could gain a competitive advantage thus potentially increasing their market share.
