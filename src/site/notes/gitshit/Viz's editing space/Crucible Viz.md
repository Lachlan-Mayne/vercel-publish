**(Chose Crucible on purpose in year 10 when we first studied classic literature. Crouch approves these notes and says I could use the ones I made back then)**

LI:  
We are learning to make objective judgments about the literary value of different types of text.

  

SC:  
To be able to understand that a classic text is objectively better than a social media text. 

  

Classics - Literature 

- Social media is the opposite of classics.
    
- Tweets, caption posts. Instagram, group chat, YouTube.
    
- Advertisements - targeted, influencers 
    
- Twitch, message boards
    
- Classics are un-favored due to their age
    
- Good classics are good if they stand the test of time, being able to stay relevant over a long period of time. To be relevant to all periods of time.
    
- Wide, universal appeal
    
- These classics are just GOOD.
    
- There's something good about these classics
    
- Cultural impact is also important
    
- Impact from Shakespeare comes from the amount of words that he created
    
- Consensus amongst critics, this majority helps 
    

  
  

The reading of classic texts.

Subjective and objective.

Objective means that it is true regardless of the person's opinion

Subjective has to do with the individual, their own truth

  

English tends to revolve around a subjective truth.

But can you be objective about English?

 Can we say that a text is better than another text?

How do you prove that a text is better than another?

  

Postmodernism

- everything is very subjective, everything is relative and not absolute
    

  

There is an opposite idea that everything in this world is very set out and is quite objective

This leads to conflicting views in society that can later effect how we view classic literature ;l5

  
  
  
  

How do we judge whether something is worth forcing you to read

Classic literature is objectively better than other form of literature

  

If objective truth exists, we call that reality.

We try and use language to talk about reality, words are objective, an objective way to talk about something. We use them to make sense to the world around us.

  

The opposite of lying, not connecting language to reality

If the themes connect to reality, it is ok.

There are some things in life that can only be shown through stories rather than essays

Stories are the way we use language to connect to reality

All the good stories are able to connect us to the real world 

  

Language can accurately capture reality

Good language should reflect the truth about world.

It can be judged by how well it represents the truths about our world

  

The Crucible, words

Barbados

Gibberish

puritanism

Hysteria

  

The crucible

The opening

Girl is unconscious and asleep and the affair happens 

  

Crossing of the threshold

Elizabeth is accused of witchcraft and then spills other details about other members which leads to story unfolding

  

The crucible page 111:

  

Danforth tells Mary Warren that she will be hanged unless she confesses so Mary turns on JP by accusing him of having joined with the Devil. Proctor, prompted by Danforth to confess, instead declares that, "God is dead!"

  

In this section, Arthur Miller is developing a test/trial by making JP make the big decision on what to do in response to accusations. This can also be labelled as ‘man v man’ as it could really be JP vs his morals, ie himself.

  

“I see his filthy face! And it is my face, and yours, Danforth!” is said by JP showing that he sees himself as the devil and also Danforth. Danforth being the ‘devil’ through prompting JP to confess and also JP being the ‘devil’ through trying to hide his sins. “God damns our kind especially, and we will burn, we will burn together!” Is the ending statement by JP conveying that ‘all evil will burn in hell’ implying that they both are in the wrong.

  

Narrative elements:

There must be a death and resurrection, maybe a sacrifice. All is lost moment, an all time low. The hero or someone will lay down their life. Death could be literal or figurative. We need to question whether or not the death is significant or meaningful. Conclusion is the new world is created/the world changes. Maybe a new family beings, the return is the hero may go back to the old world

  

What’s happening in my book today?

Cheever and Herrick are at JP’s door with an arrest warrant for Elizabeth. They are also there to confiscate any dolls that Elizabeth might own, they find the doll that has a needle stuck in its chest which relates to Abigail being pierced in the chest with what seemed to be a needle. JP argues against Cheever and Herrick, Cheever assures that the court will recognise Elizabeth's innocence and that he himself will testify in Elizabeth's favour.

  

In act 2 of the crucible, Miller is setting up the idea of a test or trial. Quite literally a trial by putting Elizabeth in court. Through JP ripping up the warrant shows that he is willing to take a stand against the oppressive society that issued the warrant. The court like Hale believes that God has blessed the court and all decisions and judgements made are correct and just. Because of the witchcraft accusations, the court therefore does not need evidence. When Proctor talks to Mary about her testifying against Abigail in court this is JP trying to protect his reputation, Mary’s behaviour indicates her fear is stronger than her integrity which foreshadows disaster.

**An Irish Airman foresees his Death**

By [William Butler Yeats](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/william-butler-yeats)

I know that I shall meet my fate

Somewhere among the clouds above;

Those that I fight I do not hate,

Those that I guard I do not love;

My country is Kiltartan Cross,

My countrymen Kiltartan’s poor,

No likely end could bring them loss

Or leave them happier than before.

Nor law, nor duty bade me fight,

Nor public men, nor cheering crowds,

A lonely impulse of delight

Drove to this tumult in the clouds;

I balanced all, brought all to mind,

The years to come seemed waste of breath,

A waste of breath the years behind

In balance with this life, this death.

Facing death in a war
an airman is another word for a pilot and he can see his death in the skies, almost as if it is expected the next time he goes back into context. 
pilots flew in small planes and was very dangerous.

Anomaly
Is something or someone which is different from the status quo, it stands out very much and is far from standard. 

What are soldiers normally motivated by?
- for their country and their hopes for freedom once the war is over, which is presumed when THEIR side wins. 

Anomaly - motivations
Yeats uses technique called anaphora to emphasis what he is not motivated by. Repetition can be seen in the word "nor" being repeated throughout the poem. 
The poet uses anaphora of "nor" to show how all traditional motivations for soldiers do not apply to this character. 
What is he motivated by?
"A lonely impulse of delight
Drove to this tumult in the clouds"
The contrast is created between the external and internal motivations. The airman is more romantic because he is driven by an impulse that is within him.
There is also a contrast between "crowds" and the impulse which is "lonely".

Comparison to The Crucible
the persona of the poem are very different to the characters of The Crucible. 

Paradox
Another key idea that needs to be explored in both texts is the concept of paradox. Most of the time we expect things in life to make logical sense and predictable. Paradox's are the opposite, these draw attention to ideas and help them contradict and go against what is predicted. 

Why Paradox's?
Human experience is sometimes complicated. Some things in life pull us in opposite directions. Good texts try to avoid being neat and simplistic. 
Paradoxes are helpful for us when trying to understand complicated and contradictory feelings. 

W.B Yeats' poem "An Irish Airman Foresees His Death" challenges human experiences through exploring anomalies in the airman's motivation which is personalising the soldiers and giving a sense of individuality. Yeats uses the technique anaphora to emphasise what the airman is not motivated by. Repetition can be seen in the word "nor" being repeated throughout the poem. These ideals challenged my understanding of soldier's motivation for fighting in wars, as the airman seems to be quite accepting of his fate, thus conflicts with  the status quo. 
These anomalies encourage paradoxical emotion towards the poems ideas, specifically through the airman's character, a soldier in a war who has nothing to fight for.  The human experiences within the poem are complicated and are explored through paradoxical thinking to shed light on individuality and how motivation can be perceived. 

Upon reading the poem for the first time, I was challenged by the lack of attachment that the soldier had towards his situation. His anomalous mindset led me to rethink my understanding of individuals incentives through contrasting internal and external motivation. I eventually found that the airman seems to be more romantic because he is driven primarily by the impulse within him rather than external factors that could impact his motivation. Through this I am able to sympathise with the airman by seeing that because he is missing the obligation to fight and as a result, has shifted his mindset towards accepting his inevitable fate. Overall, Y.B Yeats' poem has led me to question my own understanding of human experience, challenging my beliefs on where motivation is drawn from and how this could differ from societal norms. 


Question:
Have I properly explained how the anomalies are explored. 
Do I need to improve the level of first person reflection.
