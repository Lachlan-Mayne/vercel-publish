4 potential strategies to discuss in report:

  

1. performance objectives – quality, speed, dependability, flexibility, customisation, cost
    

new product or service design and development

  

2. quality management
    

– control

– assurance

– improvement

  

3. technology – leading edge, established
    

  

4. overcoming resistance to change – financial costs, purchasing new equipment, redundancy payments, retraining, reorganising plant layout, inertia
    

  
  

OPENING LINE:

Implementing and utilising operations strategies provides an opportunity for the business to have an advantage over its competitors through ensuring the business is more “efficient” to consumers. This as a result leads to achieving broader business goals, differentiation, and an overall increase in the business’ success and efficiency. At Qantas, operations is the basis for its success, with it contributing the most to business revenue (school provided case study) hence it is crucial for effective strategies to be implemented.

  
  

Performance objectives are implemented in business in efforts to make the business more profitable and productive, mainly when these goals are applied to the transformation process. The key performance objectives a business may consider quality, ﬂexibility, speed, customisation, dependability, cost. Qantas as a business, successfully implements all these objectives in order to achieve their goals and create a strong and successful foundation and standard for their business operations. 

  

Technology is useful for businesses for improving administrative tasks easier. it  can also be used in changing the way the business carries out input, transformation processes and output in regards to their goods or services. Qantas has been seen to implement technology to make the experience better for consumers and provides a competitive advantage. This is shown through countless processes, such as the introduction of online “check-in” procedures which allow travellers the option to not queue in line for a manual check in. This introduction also lets Qantas reduce expenses on paper costs and personnel. Qantas is using technology to improve the quality of service as well by using new planes which carry more passengers and use less fuel, including up-to-date flight planning technology which results in operational and fuel efficiency benefits.– go into a bit more depth, elaborate on these a bit more… now link.  Overall, Qantas successfully utilises technology to improve the overall quality of  service itself and all processes that relate to it, allowing it to be a more desirable option among its competitors  due to the efficient experience developed. ASK TEACHER IF NEED TO MENTION LEAD EDGE AND ESTABLISHED AND GIVE EXAMPLE OF BOTH?

  

Overcoming the resistance to change is an aspect that all businesses will face during their life, this means that they need to be prepared to manage change that affects the business. Problems for a business can either come from internal or external factors, such as legislation changes, shifts in the economy and new technology, staff initiative and the innovation of goods and services. One of the ways in which Qantas shows resistance to change includes the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. The SARS epidemic, fuel prices and changing customer demands. 

Significant resistance points include financial  resistance, redundancy costs, retraining costs and plant layout costs. 

Another instance where Qantas is met with resistance can be found in human restrictions, mainly from the influence of established work groups. The idea of interior and a change in skill sets are both areas where a resistance is most seen. To reduce any resistance to change of employees, managers and supervisors need to aim for a positive working environment and culture in order for the employees to more so accept the change that occurs regardless of the nature. The main reasons behind resistance can include; purchasing new equipment, redundancy payouts, and restructuring within the workplace.

Change models are helpful for management within an organisation, this allows for a consistent and effective method for businesses to analyse change and how it can be promoted. An effective approach to understanding the process of change is a force field analysis, this is where the result of driving forces conflicting with restricting forces which creates restriction. For example, some driving forces for change within Qantas include, reducing the risks of low frill airlines emerging, using the development of low costs platforms to help negotiate solutions with unions. And the success of Jetstar in competing for Virgin Blue’s market share. These driving forces for change are then clash with restraining forces against change which include; the start up costs for establishing Jetstar International airline, industrial conflict with unions. And Qantas historically few full service airlines have been able to manage a discount carrier without damaging its core operations. 

  

  
Internal factors are not the only thing that can subject a company such as Qantas to be subject to change in external factors such as competition within the industry, companies that use service differentiation can have an impact on Qantas’ operations as that might aid them in remaining relevant, however a sudden change can be tedious to overcome, and a strong operations management is needed in response. Qantas have their own means of service differentiation, an example of this would be their ownership of Jetstar. The Qantas group benefit from owning another airline through how they are able to offer a similar service for a different cost appealing to a broader market, while keeping the majority of  their operations and production process consistent. 

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

PART 2 of the  assessment: 

  

Assess the value of OUTSOURCING (acknowledging the advantages and disadvantages)

Assess: to decide the quality or importance of something. — done. 

  

Para 1. Outsourcing is known as when a business utilises external providers to  benefit them, by performing a part of the operations process, such as … Businesses tend to outsource as this can be more cost and time efficient, and certain skills and tools can be utilised which may not be readily available to the business. Qantas is one of the many businesses which outsources heavily within its operations, and has deemed to be  very successful and has highly improved the quality of service the business has to offer, however there are also some disadvantages which come along when a business chooses to outsource. 

  

Para 2. Within Qantas, outsourcing has been proven relatively successful in terms of saving in overall costs and labour, and increasing efficency and accuracy. According to.. (reference,[https://www.studocu.com/en-au/u/26245224?sid=0169](https://www.studocu.com/en-au/u/26245224?sid=01698048745) ), • Decreased net capital expenditures from an average of $1,662M between 2017-2020 to $693M

in 2021.21, Increased operating margins for FY21 of 36.0% from 0.9% in FY20. Predicted decrease in staffing costs by $100M a year. Outsourcing is partially responsible for these benefits. Following is referenced from the 20pg handout provided), Qantas benefits from outsourcing financially due to saving money in capital outlay, as machinery and operations space do not have to be provided by the business itself. Qantas additionally profits from input being at a lower cost from an external business compared to if Qantas were to manufacture the input themselves. (SUCH AS?? WHAT INPUT??(following is from textbook) Most importantly, Qantas has experienced an increased process capability, which occurs when the business has access to improved technologies and highly skilled labour. For example, Qantas signed an outsourcing deal with IBM Global Services, where IBM will manage the data center and majority of Qantas’ It systems. This allows Qantas to benefit from modern technology without the requirement of high costs to purchase, install and learn to use it, additionally, it allows the business to save on labour costs. For example, one of the technological benefits Qantas’ outsourcer IBM provides is an online check in. This saves costs involved in real-life check ins, and additionally shortens cues while making a faster and more efficient process for the customers, as previously mentioned, adding to the businesses success.  

  

  
  
  

  

IBM Global Services has signed a $446 million IT outsourcing deal with Australian airline Qantas Airways Ltd. IBM will manage the data center and other IT systems for the Sydney-based airline, the companies said in a statement released today.

  

- Call centre was outsourced to Melbourne operator salesforce.
    

  

-   
    

  

  

Para 3. While there are numerous advantages which have accounted for Qantas’ success in terms of outsourcing, there are also disadvantages and consequences which must be considered. One of the main disadvantages being a false sense of security to Qantas’ employees with the possibility of being made redundant. This would result in unions within Qantas being heavily opposed to the idea of outsourcing in regards to human resources and management. One scenario where this has occurred within Qantas is the business choosing to outsource in the baggage handling sector, mainly to a company called  Swissport, to save money on staff and equipment. While this may have saved Qantas money, in this case, the negative outweighed the positive. In this decision, Qantas made a large number (how many roughly?) of workers redundant. This resulted in devastated workers, who felt the decision was unfair and unjust leading them to turn to the courts. Qantas’ reputation and public image was diminished in the process, with it appearing Qantas did not hold a high level of care for their staff if willing to leave so many without jobs.  After this, Qantas eventually suffered a shortage of baggage handlers which affected the quality of service provided to customers negatively and significantly, with heavy delays and lost baggage a common issue.

  
  
  

Another disadvantage to outsourcing is its effect on quality though the standard is no longer under Qantas’ monitoring as it is managed by an external business. – say a bit more on this but come back to last… as have a lot here, but realisticallt, one exmaple isnt neough. – could potentially get rid of this para tbh

While it is factual Qantas benefits quite highly financially from outsourcing, it can decrease the companys morale and worker satissfaction. This in turn affects and jeapordises the motivation and efforts of the staff members which has drastic effects, such as lowered productivity, and can even effect the mental health of staff members. Overall, it dependent on what  a business values more and what their overall goal is, however if Qantas wants  to continue with a high net profit, outsourcing is an effective way to do so, but the effect this has on existing employees must be considered in the process.

Things  to  mention:

- POTENTIALLY - vertical  integration, which is the opposite of outsourcing, business  performs operations in-house - e.g qantas has its own catering.
    

  
  

OUTSOURCING FOR QANTAS -

  

So id say  250 words on advantages, and 150-200 on disadvantages..  Make sure the message we get across is:  OUTSOURCING CAN  BE  VERY ADVANTAGEOUS TO THE BUSINESS OVERALL SUCCESS, …BUT THERE ARE DISADVAVNTAGES AND IT COMES WITH ITS CONSEQUENCES… – ESSENTIALLTY WE WANT TO SAY.. SAVES BIZ MONEY AND INCREASES EFFICIENCY BUT SOMETIMES DOENST MAKE STAFF EXISTING HAPPY – MAYBE LWOERS MORALE??

|- VISARLS TEXTBOOK - Business studies in action <br>    <br>- Outsourcing brings a number of beneﬁts, including cost<br>    <br><br>savings, the capacity to have specialised support, the<br><br>simplification of business processes and improvements in quality. This can be seen in the outsourcing of ﬁnancial<br><br>processes to India by Australia’s ‘big four’ banks that have become both increasingly efﬁcient and also proﬁtable.<br><br>  <br>  <br><br>- Simpliﬁcation. This arises from reducing the number of activities performed within the business.<br><br>• Efﬁciency and cost savings. Access to cheaper labour, regulatory differences and skilled labour in offshore<br><br>locations all lead to cost savings for business.<br><br>• Increased process capability. This comes from access to improved technologies and highly skilled labour.<br><br>Improved process capability means products are produced and delivered to the market with improved levels<br><br>of service.<br><br>• Increased accountability. This is achieved through the use of service level agreements (SLAs), which<br><br>contractually bind the vendor to pre-determined targets on KPIs<br><br>• Access to skills/resources lacking within the business. A business outsourcing to a nation such as India or<br><br>Vietnam, may well ﬁnd that there is access to highly skilled and disciplined labour at low cost. This gives a<br><br>double saving as there is then no need to spend money on training and developing labour resources.<br><br>• Capacity to focus on core business or key competencies. The use of outsourcing enables a business to focus<br><br>on that which it cannot outsource: its vision, purpose, sustainable advantage through innovation, and so on.<br><br>• Strategic beneﬁts. There are four important aspects to this.<br><br>• The ﬁrst beneﬁt arises from using outsourcing to avoid trade barriers. For example, global businesses<br><br>may offshore into different Chinese provinces to become a ‘local’ supplier and hence get around barriers<br><br>that prevent foreign companies from trading.<br><br>• A second beneﬁt is that the use of a vendor that outsources for others within the same industry can bring<br><br>the beneﬁt of expertise gained from outsourcing to competitors.<br><br>• A third beneﬁt arises from trading in different time zones. The use of India, Malaysia, the Philippines,<br><br>Vietnam and China for processing work allows businesses in Australia, USA and Europe to conduct<br><br>operations during the day and to have processing work done overnight by the outsourcing vendor.<br><br>• A fourth beneﬁt is that strong partnerships between the business and the outsourcing vendor can lead to<br><br>the vendor suggesting innovative solutions to the business that may increase the business efﬁciency and<br><br>productivity over time.<br><br>• Improvements to in-house performance. A business using outsourcing and therefore focusing on core<br><br>competencies can improve in-house performance as it can really focus on making internal changes that<br><br>reduce cost and improve proﬁtability.|- VISARLS TEXTBOOK - Business studies in action <br>    <br>- However, outsourcing has also been criticised. For example, when Bonds decided to outsource there was<br>    <br><br>a perception by Australian consumers that quality would be compromised. Moreover, the loss of domestic<br><br>employment caused negative publicity. Nevertheless, the same consumers who criticise businesses that use<br><br>outsourcing as an option often take advantage of the lower prices that result. For example, Virgin and Optus<br><br>customers beneﬁt from discounted telecommunications costs in part as a result of the use of outsourcing of the<br><br>call centre to the Philippines.<br><br>  <br><br>- Cost versus beneﬁts. This refers to how long it takes to repay the cost of organising outsourcing and make<br>    <br>- the required organisational changes. Over time businesses will experience cost savings; however, it could<br>    <br>- take two or three years. If a business reduces internal inefﬁciencies, businesses may become more efﬁcient<br>    <br>- and productive without using outsourcing.<br>    <br>- • Communication and language. This is an issue between the business and the outsourcing vendor, and is a<br>    <br>- key issue in managing the relationship. When negotiating to outsource, the business might focus too much<br>    <br>- on the decision to outsource rather than consider the ongoing relationship with the vendor (which typically<br>    <br>- lasts three to ﬁve years). This can lead to confusion over expectations. Moreover, as outsourcing often<br>    <br>- occurs across two or more regions, there can be cultural differences, language differences and differences<br>    <br>- in the way business issues and problems are managed. This can lead to a misalignment between the<br>    <br>- business and the outsourcing vendor. There may also be misunderstandings about what the agreed service<br>    <br>- levels are and what KPI measures are acceptable.<br>    <br>- • Loss ofcontrol ofstandards and information security. When a business opts to outsource, it can feel a<br>    <br>- loss of control over standards and also over how information is used. Recent issues have occurred where<br>    <br>- a Chinese manufacturer of toys for the Mattel brand (a leading USA toy brand) did not adhere to the design<br>    <br>- speciﬁcations outlined in the SLA and used too much lead in toys. Similarly, Australian banks have found<br>    <br>- privacy within outsourced operations in India may not be as secure as it is was when the functions were<br>    <br>- performed in-house.<br>    <br>- • Hierarchies. A business using outsourcing may be aiming to eliminate costs associated with hierarchies,<br>    <br>- yet managing complex outsourcing agreements can create its own hierarchies, thereby maintaining business<br>    <br>- inefﬁciency.<br>    <br>- • Organisational change and redesign. Outsourcing may be accompanied by a high level of business change<br>    <br>- and organisational redesign. There may be downsizing, causing the loss of domestic employment. An<br>    <br>- option can exist for job migration for employees who may be losing work to gain employment in the<br>    <br>- outsourcing vendor business. However, even if desired, work permits/work visas may prevent this from<br>    <br>- being an option.<br>    <br>- • Loss ofcorporate memory and vulnerability. A signiﬁcant disadvantage arises from the reliance on the<br>    <br>- outsourcing provider. Key knowledge of processes and solutions may be lost with the transfer of business<br>    <br>- processes to outside parties. To counter this, some businesses such as the banks create ‘shadow teams’<br>    <br>- to retain corporate knowledge and, if required, processing capability. Business may also require that the<br>    <br>- outsourcing vendor have strategies in place in case there is a regional crisis (such as an earthquake) that<br>    <br>- severely disrupts communication and leads to information losses.<br>    <br>- • Information technology. As the use of outsourcing grows so too does the need for supporting information<br>    <br>- technology (IT). There is a cost and time associated with the use and adaptation of IT to the speciﬁc<br>    <br>- requirements of the business and the outsourcing vendor. The cost and time can signiﬁcantly reduce any<br>    <br>- ﬁnancial advantages accruing in the short term with the use of outsourcing.|
