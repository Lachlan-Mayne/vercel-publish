## Operations management:

- Responsible for acquiring the inputs and devising the best production methods so that the value adding occurs
- The strategic role of operations management in business is to play a part in ensuring that the goals of the organisation are met.
- Generally, business goals have to do with profit maximisation, which is achieved through maximising revenue and minimising costs. Expense minimisation.

  
## Cost Leadership:

- Cost is how much the business pays for a good, price is how much the customer does
- Cost leadership is working towards being the lowest cost manufacturer in the industry

Can be achieved by different production technology, more efficient staffing etc. Cost leadership is only successful if a business is able to produce goods or services at the lowest possible cost whilst they are still acceptable to customers. By reducing costs of production and distribution, a business will be able to gain an advantage over competitors.

- If the strategy is successful, the business will become the leading provider of a particular good or services based on their lowered costs.
- Businesses adopting a cost leadership strategy commonly have standardised products.(Kia is a good example)

## **There are many ways of reducing costs, with main categories including:**
- Input
- Labour
- Processing
- Inventory
- Quality management
- Automation and mass production contribute to economies of scale

One company that can save themselves a lot of money for example is Startrack, checking their haul security so they don’t lose products ≈≈ money.

**Economies of scale are the cost advantages companies gain from increasing their output. For example, the same setup would be there for 1 unit AND 1 million units of a product.**

Qantas’ competitive advantage over their rivals comes from being able to have the lowest production costs possible. Over 5 years Qantas has managed to cut 3.2 Billion, with plans for a further 15 Billion to be cut over the next 3 years.

**Qantas achieves cost-leadership through:**

- Economies of scale
- Strategic alliances
- Standardised product offers
- Technology
- Waste reduction

## Types of differentiation:

- Varying the amount of time spent on a service
- Varying the levels of expertise brought to a service
- Varying the qualifications and experience of service provider
- Varying the quality of materials/technology used in service delivery

**Product differentiation is simply making your business different from the rest in order to stand out.**

Differentiation at Qantas:

- Emphasis on being Australian
- Using multiple brands (Jetstar for “no frills” and Qantas for the “full service” offering)
- Having a range of classes on flights such as first, business, econ and prem econ

Other businesses supply intangible (non-physical) products to customers. This is called a service and the businesses that provide these are found in industries such as the tertiary sector.

## **Influences:**

**- Globalisation:**
- Technology, quality expectations, cost-based competition, government policies, legal regulation, environmental sustainability
- The removal of barriers of trade between nations
- Integration between national economies and a high degree of transfer of capital, labour, intellectual capital and ideas, financial resources and technology
- Large businesses are increasingly orienting their practices towards the global market
- They seek to meet the needs of global consumers
- Global consumers seek global brands and tend to seek standardised products
- This significantly affects the operations function, which is then structured around a series of global production facilities

## Supply chain:
The range of suppliers a business has and the nature of its relationship with those suppliers.

## Global web:
The network of suppliers a business has chosen on the basis of lowest overall cost, lowest risk and maximum certainty in quality and timing of supplies.

Sourcing is an operations strategy that requires finding the suppliers needed so that production processes can be smooth flowing.  

The global web strategy is one in which the business aims to minimise cost across the range of its suppliers

|**Pros**|**Cons**|

|<p>- Access to larger markets</p><p>- Newer markets</p><p>- Newer resources</p>|<p>- Job loss to countries with lower pay</p><p></p>|

  

## **Quality expectations:**

Quality refers to how well designed, made and functional goods are, and the degree of competence with which services are organised and delivered.

- Quality expectations are therefore the understanding of a products ability to satisfy stated or implied needs

**Factors can affect the expectations of a customer such as:**
- Price
- Ads
- Reviews
- Context

**What is the difference between quality and price?**
Higher price often tends to correlate with higher quality whereas a lower price can lead to a lower quality expectation.

**What would be the implications for a business that failed to meet quality expectations?**
They would lose customers, and potential future profits.

**What would be the implications of a business that successfully met quality expectations?**
They would have an increase in revenue for as long as they are able to exceed the expectations that customers have for them.
## **There is an intrinsic link between price and quality**

**Cost based competition** is derived from determining the breakeven point and then applying strategies to create cost advantages over competitors.  

## **Government Policies:**

- Government policies change from time to time, usually due to a change in government or a change in social expectations
- Government policy is a major influence on operations because all businesses operate in a political–legal environment
- Political decisions affect the rules and regulations that a business must follow, which, in turn, directly affects each function - particularly operations

**What might be an example of a government policy that influences the operations functions of a business?**
The government taxing certain goods or services can influence the operations functions of a business. An example of this would be the cigarette tax imposed by the government. It requires companies to have an extra tax on the ability to sell cigarettes; thus limiting the profitability of them by a small margin.


## Policies that impact business operations may include:
- Taxation rates
- Required materials handling practices
- Work health and safety (WHS) standards
- Training and rules
- Public health policies
- Environmental policies
- Employment relations
- Trade and industry policies

## **Influence on Qantas operations:**

During the pandemic Qantas retired their 6 remaining 747s, grounded around 100 aircraft including most of their international fleet for up to 12 months, put all its 12 Airbus A380s into storage in Mojave Desert and deferred deliveries of new planes – a huge impact on Operations as a result of Government Covid policies.

Taking care of grounded planes impacted what Operations did. Planes were towed periodically, aircraft cleaned inside and out, engines turned over etc.

Operations had to introduce a deep clean of aircrafts into their process (as a means of quality management). The aircraft was also forced to replace their High-Efficiency Particle Filters (HEPA).

Normally items like blankets, pillows and headphones were cleaned and reused, but they needed to be thrown out or even destroyed.

## **Legal Regulations:**

- Another highly significant external influence is the range of laws with which a business must comply
- All parts of a business, not just operations must abide by the relevant laws
- Relevant laws for operations will relate to labour and labour management, the environment and public health

|**Legal Area**|**What it consists of**|
| :-: | :-: |
|Labour laws|Minimum wage, award wages, hours, breaks, leave, workers compensation and health and safety laws|
|Environmental and public health|Regulations stopping dumping, pollution|
|Business and licensing rules|Particular levels of training or certification, conditions on operations|
|Taxation|Levies and duties, taxes imposed on profits, superannuation. Tax can be applied in such a way as to encourage particular practices, or discourage others|
|Trade practices|Market power, misleading and unfair conduct, price collusion, monopoly behaviour, market concentration|
|Migration and the use of offshore skilled labour|Minimum standards for labour brought in from other nations|
|Intellectual property|Moral rights such as copyright, patents, trademarks, designs and other original ideas and artistic works|
|Financial and accounting regulations|Standardise methods and rules around financial reports and record, as well as ensuring that company directors follow certain rules|
|Human rights|Rules restricting discrimination|

## **Corporate Social Responsibility:**

- It involves businesses doing more than just complying with the laws and regulations
- Also known as the ‘triple bottom line,’ CSR places value on financial returns as well as social responsibility and environmental sustainability
- CSR - the difference between legal compliance and ethical responsibility

## **Inputs at Qantas:**

**Transformed:**
- **Materials:**
- Fossil fuels
- Food for catering
- Paper and computers

**Information:**
- Gov stats
- Market and industry reports
- Media reports
- Academic papers
- Financial operation stats, data on prev performance

**Customers:**
- Transformed by transportation from one location to another

**Transforming:**
- Human resources:
- Everyone from the cleaners and baggage handlers to the pilots and sales managers
- Facilities/capital:
- Terminal buildings and contents
- Maintenance facilities

**The 4 V’s:**
- Volume: How much of a product is made
- Variety: The range of products made
- Variation in demand: The differing amounts of a product desired by customers
- Visibility: The nature and amount of customer contact (feedback)

**Technology:**
- Often, an increase in technology will lead to a decrease in human employees
- As technology improves, the cost is decreasing, but businesses may need to factor in the cost of redundancies
- Creates more efficiency in the transformation process

## **Customer service:**
- Customer service refers to how well a business meets and exceeds the expectations of customers in all aspects of its operations
- A satisfied customer will act as an ambassador for a business, a dissatisfied customer will have the reverse effect

**Shonky Questions:**
1. XBOX
2. They would need to fix their faulty product to try and show they care about customer satisfaction
3. Alter production to boost quality assurance. They would need to do this by changing certain parts used in the product and make sure it functions as intended before going back on the shelf

## **Performance objectives:**

- Performance objectives are goals that relate to particular aspects of the transformation processes. These objectives or targets will be set so that the business becomes more efficient, productive and profitable
- **There are 6 key performance objectives in operations:**
	- Quality
	- Speed
	- Dependability
	- Flexibility
	- Customisation
	- Cost

  
  

|**Cost**|**Method to reduce**|
| :-: | :-: |
|Operations generally|One of the biggest cost centres. Managers are constantly looking for ways to reduce overall operational costs, they run initiatives for this to identify new ways to achieve cost-savings|
|Wages/salaries|Introduction of self-service kiosks reduce wage costs in store. Exploring the idea of a virtual store and home delivery options to reduce these further|
|Rising food prices|Reducing the menu offerings for later at night; this prevents waste and speeds up service in a non-peak time|


## Dependability - Iphone
When apple released the iPhone 5a (2013) it had significant issues with the fingerprint sensor and there were technical issues with the maps app

## Flexibility: Toilet paper

Flexibility is how quickly operations can adjust to changes in the market  
It can be best achieved by increasing the capacity of production

- For goods, this can be done by using plant, machinery, or technology better than before
- With services, flexibility can be achieved through increasing the number of service providers, increasing their skill level and through technology used when providing the service.  
    During the pandemics toilet paper hoarding, many toilet paper businesses (e.g. Charmin) recognised the boom wouldn't last forever
- The business ran **double shifts and increased production rates** for their factories
- They did NOT hire thousands of new workers or built extra factories because **they understood that this was very short term**

## Customisation:
Creation of individual products to meet customer needs

## Cost:
The amount a business pays for its goods

## New product or service design & development:
This is all about the process of a business bringing a new product or service into the market.
**It involves;**
- Identifying a market opportunity – what new product/service might be needed by people? Or something that people might want?
- Creating a product – particularly one that will be appealing
- Testing and modifying the product until it’s ready for  production

## Why?
**Often businesses do this to gain or maintain competitive advantage. It may be done to better satisfy the needs of existing customers and/or attempt to sell to new customers.**

## Development:
The coming up with and screening of ideas as well as identifying the commercial aspects (marketing and product launch and forecasting etc)

## Design:
The activities involved in creating the styling, appearance, feel, etc of the product, deciding on the product’s mechanical make up, selecting materials and processes and engineering these so that they work.
**The following flowchart indicates the product design and development process**

## Supply Chain Management:
**Supply chain management involves figuring out and managing the flow ofsupplies through inputs, transformation processes and outputs in order to best meet the needs of the customer.
It is essentially, the sequence of activities and organisation involved in producing a good or service, it is concerned with making sure all this happens in an efficient and cost effective way.**

**Its goals include:**
- Reducing inventory
- Increasing the speed of transactions and increasing revenue for a business by satisfying customer demands.

**The three key aspects of supply chain management include;**
- Logistics
- E-commerce
- Global sourcing

The supply chain for a product can be determined by starting with the final product and then tracing backwards through all processes that add value, all the way back to inputs

## Sourcing:
- Sourcing is all about acquiring, purchasing or procuring (fancy names  for buying) the inputs needed for the transformation process.
- “Sources” or the inputs you use, come from suppliers
- When choosing which sources to use, Supply Chain Managers think about the following:
![gitshit/Pete r/images/Screen Shot 2023-11-10 at 12.37.02 pm.png](/img/user/gitshit/Pete%20r/images/Screen%20Shot%202023-11-10%20at%2012.37.02%20pm.png)

## Global Sourcing:
- Same as sourcing, but this time on a global scale
- It's basically buying or sourcing from wherever the suppliers are the best at meeting the sourcing requirements
![gitshit/Pete r/images/Screen Shot 2023-11-10 at 12.39.45 pm.png](/img/user/gitshit/Pete%20r/images/Screen%20Shot%202023-11-10%20at%2012.39.45%20pm.png)

## Challenges of Global Sourcing:
- **The possible relocation of aspects of operations**
- **The increased cost of logistics**
- **Storage and distribution**
- **Managing different regulatory conditions between nations** 
- **The increasing complexity of overall operations when sourcing from diverse locations**

## E-Commerce:
- E-commerce involves the buying and selling of goods and services via the internet. With reference to supply chain management, it’s linked to the sourcing of your inputs.
- Supply chain can be managed through electronic ordering, e-procurement is the name for the system where on-line systems to manage supply levels, updating suppliers when a business is low and may need to re-stock.

## Logistics:
- **All about managing the flow of materials, info and other resources between supply and consumption**
- Logistics is a term referring to distribution but also includes:
	- Transportation
	- The use of storage, warehousing and distribution centres
	- Material handling and packaging
- Distribution refers to the ways of getting goods or services to the desired customers
- **Transportation is concerned with the physical movement of inventories**
- Storage involves finding a secure place to hold stock until it is required
- Warehousing is the use of a facility for the storage, protection and, later, distribution of stock
- Distribution centre (slightly different to a warehouse) not intended for long term storage, instead, strategically located so as to minimise the time it takes to supply stock to retail outlets
- Materials handling and packaging involves choosing the appropriate methods for the goods or services involved

## Outsourcing
Outsourcing is the use of external, third-party providers to perform business activities for a business.
Businesses outsource:
- Labour
- Raw Materials
- Production Aspects
- Finance -> Accounting, Payroll, Management
- Legal -> Advice, Representation
- Call centres
- Security
- Marketing -> Market Research, Advertising, Design
- HR/Recruitment
- Sales leads
- Legal Services
- Research & Development

## Technology:
- Technology is important for all businesses
- The use of technology allows businesses to obtain competitive advantage
- Businesses need to make the decision to use either leading edge technology, established technology, or a combination of both
- **Leading edge technology: most advanced or innovative at any point in time**
- Established technology is technology that has been developed and is widely used already
- They may not offer a competitive advantage, but not using them might be a competitive disadvantage
- **Leading edge is about getting ahead, established is about maintaining pace**

## Tech in Qantas:
**- Kiosk self-service:**
	- Established
**- Airbus A350-1000:**
	- Leading edge
**- In-flight entertainment:**
	- Established
**- Flight tracking:**
	- Established
**- Bio-fuel:**
	- Leading edge

- **Even if a piece of technology is established, it can still be a leading cause for streamlining production process**
- Companies won't always use leading edge technology if it's inefficient at meeting customer expectations

## Inventory Management:
Businesses that buy stock need to decide how much to carry in inventories.
- **LIFO (last-in-first-out)** Stock that has arrived most recently will be sold first
	- Bulky items; fridges, lounges, non-perishables
- **FIFO (first-in-first-out)** Stock that has been waiting the longest is sold first
	- Perishables; milk, fruit etc
- **JIT (just-in-time)** Businesses aim to only make enough to meet demand, in time for the demand
	- Customisable items; restaurants, café's etc
These are all ideas that relate to how you deal with the stock you have, thinking about rotating it or arranging like items on a shelf
