## Inventory Management

##### 3 main methods of managing inventory
- LIFO (last-in-first-out) - stock that has arrived most recently will be sold first
	- Bulky items; fridges, lounges. Non-perishables
- FIFO (first-in-first-out) - stock that has been waiting the longest is sold first (arrived least recently)
	- Perishables (milk, fruit etc)
- JIT (just-in-time) - businesses aim to only make enough to meet demand, in time for the demand
	- Customisable
