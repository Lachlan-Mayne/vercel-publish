Poem: An Irish Airman foresees his Death
By William Butler Yeats

	I know that I shall meet my fate
	Somewhere among the clouds above;
	Those that I fight I do not hate,
	Those that I guard I do not love;
	My country is Kiltartan Cross,
	My countrymen Kiltartanâ€™s poor,
	No likely end could bring them loss
	Or leave them happier than before.
	Nor law, nor duty bade me fight,
	Nor public men, nor cheering crowds,
	A lonely impulse of delight
	Drove to this tumult in the clouds;
	I balanced all, brought all to mind,
	The years to come seemed waste of breath,
	A waste of breath the years behind
	In balance with this life, this death.

What are the key experiences the poet is trying to explore?

- Coming to terms with death
- Facing death in war
- "Meet my fate" - death

Soldiers are normally motivated by:

- getting to see their family after
- ending the war
- going back home after
- patriotism - fighting for their country, love for their country
- propaganda - tricked into joining
- hate of enemies

Anomaly - Motivations

He uses the technique of anaphora to emphasised what he is not motivated by. Anaphora comes from a Greek word meaning repetition. it is when a word is repeated at the start of a number of phrases. In this poem, "Nor law, nor duty bade me fight, Nor public men, nor cheering crowds."

The poet uses the anaphora of "nor" to stress how all the traditional motivations of soldiers do not influence his decisions.
He is nor being forced to fight by the law
He is not driven by a sense of duty, doing what is right
He is not influenced by other people: politicians "public men" and "cheering crowds."

What is he motivated by?
"A lonely impulse of delight
Drove to this tumult in the clouds"
The contrast is created between the external and internal motivations.
The airman is more romantic because he is driven by an impulse that is within him.
Note also the contrast between "crowds" and the impulse which is "lonely."

Comparison to The Crucible

There is a big contrast between the two
Poem MC is uncaring about the world around him wants to do his own thing
The Crucible characters care too much about how other people see them

Paradox

Another key idea that you need to explore in both texts is the concept of paradox. In real life and in texts we expect things to work together in a logical way and make sense. So we expect cause and effect and we like it when things are predictable and consistent.
Elizabeth is a person that never lies, but then she comes into a court and lies.
When things contradict each other and do not easily blend together we refer to them as a paradox.

To have peace we must prepare for war

The two opposites are "have peace" and "prepare for war". It makes sense because if the opposing force knows we are ready for war then they will be deterred from initiating the war

Why paradoxes?

Human experience is sometimes very complicated. There are aspects of our lives that pull us in opposite directions. Human experience that is dealt with in good texts tends to avoid being neat and simplistic.

The pilot facing his own death in a war is not a simple or easy thing to explain. And so Yeats uses paradoxes to help us wrestle with these complicated and contradictory feelings.

Paradox of war 

"Those that I fight I do not hate,
Those that I guard I do not love"

It would be more simple if he hated the enemy or if he loved the people he is guarding. As with the anomaly, he is different to many soldiers in the war. He is detached from the people around him and so finds himself trying to kill people that he does not hate. He will be sacrificing his life for people that he does not care for.

If war is about killing, you would expect it to be driven by very strong emotions. Yeats explores the complicated nature of war by removing the emotions 

CONTEXT - Irish soldiers

Note how the poem focuses on the nationality of the pilot. Why is it significant that he is Irish?
The context helps us here. During WW1, Ireland was seeking to be independent of the United Kingdom. There were rebellions against the British in parts of Ireland. So an Irish man fighting in the English army might feel detached or have mixed feelings (ambivalence) about dying for a country that he does not feel he belongs to. 

The Final Lines

Note how the final lines of the poem help to resolve the paradox. Yeats uses the form of the poem to convey peace and calm that the pilot feels as he brings into balance. Look at how Yeats uses rhyme scheme and the structure of the poem to reflect this calm balance.

"I **balanced** all, brought all to mind,
The years to **come** seemed 
**waste of breath**,
___
A **waste of breath** 
the years **behind**
In **balance** with this life, this death."

This is called the chiastic structure. It creates a balance and symmetry.

The resolution of the poem is that his life and death in this moment of the war make his life meaningful. When he compares the human experience of war and death in war, everything else in his life and his future seems to be a waste of breath. Paradoxically, war, which is about death, allows him to appreciate and accept the value of his life.
