# Texts & Human experiences

### reflection paragraph:
"The sun will move on, and I will simply watch." The widower in the country is a poem about the human experience of grief that almost all of its audience can relate to. As pretty much everyone in the world has experienced some form of grief,  


Hand in a 250-300 word reflection on one of the human experiences in your related text. Use the following
questions to scaffold your reflection.
1. What anomalies, inconsistencies and/or paradoxes are explored in your related text?
2. How has this text invited you to see the world differently?
## Texts Definition:

Texts are a vehicle through which we share experiences. Texts are shaped by experiences and they shape experiences. It’s through texts that we encounter and understand human experiences. This is, therefore, a study of the way texts share or represent experiences.

  

## Discuss:

1. What makes us human?

2. What is an ‘experience’?

3. Can human experiences be individual or collective?

A Poison tree (william blake):
I was angry with my friend;
I told my wrath, my wrath did end.
I was angry with my foe:
I told it not, my wrath did grow.

And I watered it in fears,
Night & morning with my tears:
And I sunned it with smiles,
And with soft deceitful wiles.

And it grew both day and night.
Till it bore an apple bright.
And my foe beheld it shine,
And he knew that it was mine.

And into my garden stole,
When the night had veiled the pole;
In the morning glad I see;
My foe outstretched beneath the tree.

1. How has the poem been structured? What’s the impact of this?
Rhyming paragraph in the form AABB
2. Discuss and annotate together what happens in each stanza
In the first stanza, the author has anger, some of which is relieved some of which stays. In the second stanza, the author discusses more of the emotions inside his mind, comparing them to water and sunlight for a plant. In the third stanza, the “tree” - that being the anger and negativity inside his mind, starts to grow, and it bears fruit - perhaps the anger leading the author to do something bad. In the final stanza, the “foe” - the person William has anger against, dies underneath the tree, perhaps signaling Williams anger has dissipated
3. Annotate what you think the following represent in the poem:
	1. Watering
	Containing more emotions internally, bottling them up alongside the anger
	2. Sunning
	Fake emotions being displayed externally, helping the internal feelings gain merit
	3. The apple
	The culmination of Williams anger/wrath, pushing him to do something to the “foe”
	4. The death of the foe
	The anger leaving Williams mind, or perhaps william doing something to the foe himself physically
	5. The garden
	Williams mental scape, that being where all his emotions are contained
	4. Annotate the key language/poetic techniques in the poem AND their effect.
	Rhyme - enhances the flow of the poem, metaphor - provides food for thought for the audience, symbolism - Blake’s mind is a garden, and his negativity is a tree
	5. What is the main human experience that Blake is exploring in this poem?
	The feeling of being wronged, or experiencing anger towards another person
	6. Why is Blake better off using figurative language to write about this experience?
	By using figurative language, Blake allows the reader to interpret their own meaning from the poem, based off the readers own human experiences.
	7. Do you agree with Blake’s views? Why/Why not?
	I agree with the fact about the mind being a garden, when you take care of your mental state you reap the garden, that being happiness and equality (?)

  

Activity: THE LAB: REFLECT - Getting personal with portraits

What is the point of this video and how does this connect to ‘Texts & Human Experiences”?

It shows us the amount of thought put into each photo taken, sort of leading into the fact that every record we leave behind should be thought about. Emotional thing - everything that people have gone through is always specific to one person, everyone reacts differently.

  

The African Begger (Raymond Tong):

Sprawled in the dust outside the Syrian store,
a target for small children, dogs and flies,
a heap of verminous rags and matted hair,
he watches us with cunning reptile eyes,
his noiseless, small-poxed face creased in a sneer.

Sometimes he shows his yellow stumps of teeth
and wines for alms, perceiving that we bear
the curse of pity; a grotesque mask of death,
with hands like claws about his begging bowl.

But often he is lying all alone
within the shadow of a crumbling wall,
lost in the trackless jungle of his pain,
clutching the pitiless red earth in vain
and whimpering like a stricken animal.

GOT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE WORDS YOU’RE USING MEAN

The one lie [John](Quotes#^b7197b) Proctor's wife gives ends up killing [John](Quotes#^b7197b), she tries to save his reputation and in turn destroys her own

The experience of fear, a common collective and individual human experience, permeates the play as many of the characters hold genuine fears for a range of reasons.

Even the location of salem, isolated on the edge of a forest fed these fears. The forest was seen as the domain of the devil, and therefore a dangerous place.
### Human experience; revenge:

1. Define revenge
Revenge is the act of taking action against someone or something who you feel has wronged you in some way

2. Why do you think revenge is such a common human experience? Do you think it is more likely to be an individual experience or a collective one? Why?
A large number of people believe in the “eye for an eye” mentality - that if somebody wrongs you, you should wrong them with the same severity, so you’re both equally wronged.

   3.i. Ann putnam: Who does Mrs Putnam want revenge against and why?
Betty - throwing her under the bus as a demon first chance, Tituba - probably race, Rebecca - belief that rebecca caused the miscarriages by midwifing,  

  3.ii Thomas Putnam: who does he want revenge against and why?
“He was a man with many grievances” - narrator, “this man is killing his neighbours for their land!” - giles
“A moment, Mr Proctor. What lumber is that you’re draggin’ if i may ask you? … Why, we are surely gone wild this year. What anarchy is this? That tract is in my bounds, it’s in my bounds, Mr Proctor.”
He is mad against the town, generally for land disputes and things relating to power, Proctor - over a land dispute, Giles and danforth - still around land, and who can claim it

  3.iii. Abigail: Elizabeth Proctor - Married to [John](Quotes#^b7197b) Proctor who Abigail wants to marry and so sees Elizabeth as competition
P26 - all the girls are trying to say we should stop now before we get too deep into the accusations
P30 - wants elizabeth gone so she can have [John](Quotes#^b7197b) Proctor to herself
P60 - Elizabeth talking about [John](Quotes#^b7197b) not blaming abigail
P70 - 
P96 - 
Mary - Mary is trying to prove Abigail wrong and so to preserve her name she denies Mary. 
‘I know not. A wind, a cold wind, has come.’ 

# Crucible notes:

## Film notes:

Movie starts in dark location, with girls dancing around a fire in the forest. The girls are “casting” love spells - likely just 

Trials in court: hysteria, mass hysteria, girl saying she can’t faint again, there was no spirits but there was, the story is shifting constantly

Lies - witch hunts - story changing

Man crushed to death is historically accurate: [https://www.masshist.org/beehiveblog/2021/09/giles-corey-pressed-to-death/](https://www.masshist.org/beehiveblog/2021/09/giles-corey-pressed-to-death/)

Bringing the total death count up to 13 thus far, 12 by hanging 1 by crushing. 

[John](Quotes#^b7197b) tears his signed confession, invalidating the document
## Play notes:

- Miller uses repetition of “i saw … with the devil” as the curtains are closing are falling
## Context:

LI: We are learning about human experiences in The Crucible and how these experiences are represented.

SC: 
- I can identify key aspects of the context of the play - both Miller’s 1950’s America & Salem 1692 and how Miller connects these two contexts. (viewing the videos and making notes from LMS)
- I can explain the purpose of the play (from notes on LMS)

[McCarthyism](Glossary#^dc5591):
- Joseph McCarthy was a member of the american parliament, he used privilege to make baseless accusations against citizens of america being communists 
- By having privilege he can’t be sued or defamed for the accusations made in session 
- Arthur Miller was accused, and didn’t give up any names to save himself, mainly because he didn’t go to the meetings 
- Gave more power to the capitalist mindset, as everyone was thinking capitalist as they got grilled by HUAC
Historical accuracy:
- Man who was crushed to death with stones was real

Cold war:
- Period of threatened violence between communist east and capitalist west (1945 - 1991)
- Communism is all organised differently to capitalism (humility vs greed)
- Timeline:
	- 1945: end of WW2, start of cold war
	- 1947: Checks conducted on the loyalty of US government workers (ARE THEY COMMUNIST??)
	- 1949: Mao Zedong proclaims China a Communist nation (USSR assisted)
	- 1950 - 1953: period of heightened ideological aggression by the USA against Communism (everyone becomes afraid of being called a communist)
	- 1950: Senator McCarthy claims 205 people in the U.S. State Department are members of the communist party
- HUAC (House Un-American Activities Committee) asked many Americans “Are you now, or have ever been a member of the Communist Party?”
- “The Other” - someone belonging not in this community (demon calling)
## Techniques:

Adultery:
- [John](Quotes#^b7197b) with [Abigail](Quotes#^3539e8)

Dramatic irony:
- [John](Quotes#^b7197b) reciting 10 commandments, ignoring the one he hasn’t kept (adultery)

Stage directions:
- Convey the sense of fear and panic, denoting mood

Symbolism:
- Black/White, Light/Heavy, etc.

Setting:
- Puritan New England, 1692
- Each act is set in one setting - offers four different views of Salem e.g. orderly calm of the Proctor’s home contrasts the emotional chaos of Parris’ home
- Right on the dark woods (the indians) representing the unknown (where the devil is) church is the centre, Proctor on a farm therefore on the outside
- The setting highlights the life and death struggle, raising the stakes of the play

Characterisation:
- Characters are conventional. They are individually and collectively represented. (sympathy and engagement with the characters) Almost all of the main characters are represented in very human with flaws and strengths

Dialogue:
- Believable dialogues for the C17th Puritans; convincingly old fashioned without being hard to understand. Partly based on research from Salem court records. Apart from a few words, such as ‘harlot’, the vocabulary is essentially modern. Miller achieves this by echoing the language of the King James Bible - linking words in unusual ways, using double negatives, changing verb tenses.

Farce:
- The girls clambering over the pews, saying the “birds” have a face of whoever

Allegory: 
- Salem witch trials used to warn audience about dangers of McCarthyism
- Narrator argues that “political inspiration of the Devil” began centuries before the witch trials - the Spanish inquisition, Martin Luther. This extends the allegory to be about the dangers of “mob mentality and unchecked political authority”
## Language forms and features in the crucible:

Goal: to understand the ways language is used to shape representations in texts

Dramatic form: 
- Acts and scenes
- Stage directions
- [Authorial Intrusions](Glossary#^caf53e)
- Action
- Gestures
- Facial expressions
- Dialogue
- Sound Effects
- Lighting
- Costume
- Props
- Scenery
- Paradoxical settings
- Character conflict (eg [John Proctor](Quotes#^b7197b))

Language features:
- Historically authentic language
- Some archaic language (some has been modernised)
- Double negatives
- Theological Language/jargon/terminology
- Legal language/jargon/terminology
- Character specific diction e.g. Danforth speaks more formally than those from Salem
- Foreshadowing
- Used quite frequently throughout the play. Despite a range of audience members assumedly knowing the historical context of the Salem Witch Trials, Miller employs this technique often throughout the play

- Symbolism    
- Hot and cold
- Documentation and books
- Poppets
- Crucible
- Colours: black, white and red

# Essay writing
## Using the TEEL structure:
Well structured paragraphs are important because if the information is well organised it is easier to read.
The TEEL strategy is very helpful for knowing what should be included in a paragraph:
- Topic sentence (contains the main idea is usually first in the paragraph)
- Explain
- Evidence and example (use references)
- Link (refer back or sum up main idea) - optional

Example paragraph:
What anomalies and paradoxes are there in the Crucible?
T: Paradoxes are an effective method of an author communicating a message with their audience. 
E: Within storytelling, an author writes a text to convey a meaning towards the audience, often a collective human experience. 
E: Within the crucible, Arthur Miller writes about a paradoxical historical event, the Salem witch trials. Within a Puritan (christianity-aimed religion) village, the Devil is a major scare to the citizens. The paradox within the Trials that Arthur explores is one around how a Puritan village leads themselves to turn against each other, involving the human experience of power, and how it can corrupt people. Reverend Hale believes he is immune to the Devil, yet ends up becoming worried only with keeping his own power, and his reputation over the other villagers.
L: By exploring how paradoxical the witch trials were, Arthur Miller writes an effective text explaining how power can corrupt.
