## Reflection:
- first person language, it is my own reflection
- Reflective paragraph
### Structure:
First paragraph:
A sentence on what human experience the text is about and the purpose. Exploration of anomalies, inconsistencies and/or paradoxes. Not an in-depth analysis. Focus more on the ideas - can use occasional short quotes, mention of structure, context if relevant to anomaly, etc.

Second paragraph:
Focus on how the text invites you to see the world differently. Insights? What's valued, transcends the text, adds to human experience more broadly as a universal experience, adds to the cultural conversation of literature (thoughtful/perceptive range)? Change in perspective? Challenged to think outside your normal parameters

### Other notes about structure:
Paradox in widower: the guy is completely free, yet completely stuck in his grief, imprisoned. Life can be whatever he wants, but it isn't, because he's trapped in his grief
