## Reflection:
- first person language, it is my own reflection
- Reflective paragraph
### Structure:
First paragraph:
A sentence on what human experience the text is about and the purpose. Exploration of anomalies, inconsistencies and/or paradoxes. Not an in-depth analysis. Focus more on the ideas - can use occasional short quotes, mention of structure, context if relevant to anomaly, etc.

Second paragraph:
Focus on how the text invites you to see the world differently. Insights? What's valued, transcends the text, adds to human experience more broadly as a universal experience, adds to the cultural conversation of literature (thoughtful/perceptive range)? Change in perspective? Challenged to think outside your normal parameters

### Other notes about structure:
Paradox in widower: the guy is completely free, yet completely stuck in his grief, imprisoned. Life can be whatever he wants, but it isn't, because he's trapped in his grief

## Essay:
One or two paragraphs on the widower in the country, as many paragraphs as needed for crucible.

## Inventory management:
- Inventory/Stock refers to the amount of raw materials, work-in-progress and finished goods that a business has on hand at any particular time
- Stock is the product either in partial or full transformation, which has yet to be sold
- Holding stock refers to a business keeping stock in storage available for sale, and not selling it straight away
- There is some debate in management and business about the advantages and disadvantages of holding stock
Businesses that buy stock need to decide how much to carry in inventories

3 main methods of managing inventory include:
- LIFO: last in first out. Stock that has arrived most recently will be sold first
	- What products is this useful for?
	- Bulky items: fridges, lounges. Non perishables
- FIFO: first in first out. Stock that has been waiting the longest is sold first (arrived least recently)
	- What products is this useful for?
	- Food: fruit, chips, tea. Perishables
- JIT: just in time. Businesses aim to only make enough to meet demand, in time for the demand
	- What products is this useful for?
	- Customisable: subway, pizza, etc

FIFO: This method assumes that the first unit making its way into inventory is the first sold.
Example:
Let's say that a bakery produces *200 loaves of bread on Monday at a cost of $1 each*, and *200 more on Tuesday at $1.25 each*. FIFO states that if the bakery *sold 200 loaves on Wednesday*, the *COGS is $1 per loaf* (recorded on the financial statement) **(unfinished notes)**
LIFO: This method assumes that the last unit making its way into inventory is sold first. The older inventory is therefore left over at the end of the accounting period.
Example:
For the *200 loaves sold on Wednesday*, the same bakery would *assign $1.25* **(unfinished notes)**
Inventory valuation methods: Average cost
This method is quite straightforward; it takes the weighted average of all units available for sale during the accounting period and then uses that average cost to determine the value of COGS and ending inventory.
Example:
The average cost for inventory would be $1.125 per unit, calculated as $\frac{(200\times1)+(200\times1.25)}{400 loaves}$
Jit management is just management, lifo and fifo are financial
### Inventory management at Qantas
Qantas doesn't store many products to meet customer demands, therefore inventory is not stored *planes are not sold to customers, therefore they wait in hangars, are more like the ovens at a bakery (equipment) rather than the bread or flour (inventory)* Qantas orders/prepares in flight meals etc as per bookings.
