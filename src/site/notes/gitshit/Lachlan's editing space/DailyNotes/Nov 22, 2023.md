How does the representation of power in _The crucible_ shape your understanding of the human condition?

## Trial sample 2021 (intro):

A desire for power is a primal motivation found within the human condition as it is a driving force for what we want to achieve. However, seeking power over other humans is destructive and leads to the downfall of the collective community. Arthur Miller's _The Crucible_ conveys this, through different representations of power in the form of a historical allegory to reveal the innate human motivations in Salem 1692, and his own context of the Red Scare. Miller's exploration of the human experience of reputation, injustice and transgression and redemption reveals the parallel of motivation through power in both contexts to elicit a personal reflection of the human condition.

How does the representation of power in _The Crucible_ shape your understanding of the human condition?

The multifaceted play _The Crucible_ (1953) by Arthur Miller represents the experience of desiring power through showing the devastating impacts it has on individual's morality, whereby shaping one's experience of the human condition. Through the historic tragedy, set in 1500s Salem Witch Trials, Miller allegorically illustrates and challenges the paradoxical and unjust nature of the Red Scare of 1950s McCarthyism. He achieves this through articulating the collective consequences of a motivation for power, the consequence of power being exerted on others forcing them to obsess over their reputation. It is also seen in the motivation to regain power over personal enslavement to one's transgressions through achieving redemption. Through exploring these human experiences, Miller comments on the consequences of power on the human condition, allowing the audience to better understand the world.

Science and progress are caught up with rationality and reason during the crucible where Reverend Hale says "Here is all the invisible world, caught, defined, and calculated"
The idea of binary symbolism is used more where Abigail is talking to john about his heat (passion) for her, and his cold heart for his own wife
The whole witch hunt didn't need to happen; the witch hunt happened because of paranoia

## Witch hunts and Mob Justice
Mob justice:
- Mob: large group of people intent on causing trouble
- Forced conformity: usually aimed at individuals who do not conform
- Justice: attempting to take over the process of justice:
	- Against individual freedom
	- Against "innocent until proven guilty."
	- The mob decides who is guilty
**The anomaly: the "mob" in this story is a group of young girls.**
- AND: they manipulated legitimate legal authority
- Judicial murder: Christian families commit murder using the justice system
- "Now the little crazy children are jangling the keys of the kingdom, and common vengeance writes the law!"
Unjust: it is human nature to blame others for our problems
- Rebecca: "there is prodigious danger in the seeking of loose spirits. I fear it, I fear it. Let us rather blame ourselves."
	- Rebecca is a wise character and gives the correct advice early in the play. It is ignored
	- Characters have a choice: blame "loose spirits" or take personal responsibility.


The fact the group is a bunch of girls **Is an anomaly, mobs are normally male dominated** 
Justice is not really a term that means fairness or such, in a mob sense it means getting back at someone, getting revenge

## Redemption
Another human experience seen in the crucible, as humans stuff up we want to redeem ourselves
Strong paradox within proctors guilt; christian community opposed towards adultery
Paradoxical aspect is christians being forgiving yet john is worried about not being forgiven

- Guilt: Proctor struggles with how to atone for his guilt
	- Paradox: a Christian community should be able to help people to find forgiveness, but they instead focus on judgement. 
		- "These people had no ritual for the washing away of sins" (Arthur Miller introduction)
			- Symbol: "washing", plants the question - "How can Proctor be washed clean of his sin?"
	- Moral universe:
		- There is good and evil / sin and goodness
		- Sin requires some kind of atonement
		- Atonement: to make amends for sin
- Redemption is not found in religion, but through his marriage
	- Character arc: Proctor making atonement
		- He begins by pretending to be righteous
			- Planting: the final line is set up early in the play when Proctor says to Elizabeth: "let you look sometimes for the goodness in me, and judge me not."
		- To save his wife, he publicly confesses.
		- In the end, he humbles himself and asks for forgiveness from Elizabeth
			- "I would have your forgiveness, Elizabeth"
			- John Proctors death implies that the witch trial is now over, the best man has willingly sacrificed himself
		- He willingly lays down his life for his sin
- Final line of the play: "he have his goodness now. God forbid I take it from him."
	- Strong statement of forgiveness from Elizabeth
	- Note the word "now". This suggests that his final act of telling the truth and self-sacrifice has achieved redemption
	- Hopefully tone in the end: suggests Proctors life is _not_ just a tragedy

Miller is saying the same about America in 50s as well as Salem in 1600s: people have given up their individuality for safety within the horde
Paradox: a bunch of people died in that "safe, ordered society"
## Order and freedom
Context: assumptions about individual freedom:
- Puritan Salem: individual freedom must be sacrificed for safety, order and control
- 1950s America: individual freedom is more important than control
- The paradox: both things contradict each other, but both are essential

Control/Suppression in Salem:
- Abigails control of the young girls: "I will come to you in the black of some terrible night and I will bring a pointy reckoning that will shudder you"
- Caricature of the Puritans: Miller tends to exaggerate their pettiness and need to control others
	- Caricature: drawing of someone with exaggerated facial features e.g. nose larger than normal
	- The more exaggerated claim makes it **easier** to understand Millers allegorical point
- Fear: Hale says that people must be witches because they have confessed. Proctor replies: "And why not, if they must hang for denyin' it? There are them that will swear to anything before they'll hang"
- Mary Warren tries to tell the truth and is pressured back into conforming
	- Staging: Mary may be separated from the group of girls and then gradually return to being one of them
- Imagery: Hale says, "Theology, sir, is a fortress; no crack in a fortress may be accounted small."
	- Fortress represents something united and powerful
	- Comparison: a crack is something small, unimportant
	- Hale will not accept even a crack

Heroic resistance to control:
- Proctor does not go to church and lives outside the town
- Giles Corey is pressed with stones and refuses to give up information
	- You could say he's feeling a bit pressed
- Proctor chooses not to lie in the end
- Rebecca Nurse refers to join the group looking for witchcraft

The paradox of order and freedom:
- "The balance has yet to be struck between order and freedom." (Arthur Miller)
- Anomalies: The community could not accept people who were different, they needed to be brought under control

Binary thinking:
- Binary: everything is reduced to being one extreme or another
	- "there are two kinds of people in the world"
- Human experience is rarely a simple binary
- "A person is either with this court or he must be counted against it, there be no road between"
- The Devil or God: Rebecca says she is going "to God for you" when leaving the meeting. Parris replies, "I hope you do not mean we go to Satan here!"
