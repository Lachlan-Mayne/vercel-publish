## Description of the uses and sources of ammonia:

Ammonia is one of the most used chemical compounds in the agricultural industry. It is commonly used to create fertiliser, with around 80% of all ammonia created used to make fertiliser. It can also be used in refrigeration systems, as a coolant gas, as well as used in the purification of water. 
Uses:
-       Fertiliser
-       Explosives
-       Used in other synthesis reactions 
-       Refrigeration systems
-       Pharmaceuticals
-       Paper production
-       Cleaning liquids
Sources:
-       Haber process
-       Decomposition of organic material such as waste matter/gases
-       Forest fires

## Description of the Haber Process and its importance
The Haber process is the synthetic production of ammonia, using the below formula:
$$N_{2(g)} + 3H_{2(g)} ⇌ 2NH_{3(g)}$$
$$ΔH = -92kJ/mol$$
As the reaction uses the ⇌ symbol, it is an equilibrium reaction. This means that the reaction is going both forwards and backwards at the same time, eventually reaching a point where the two rates are equal - an "equilibrium point". When this point is reached, to any observers it seems as if the reaction has reached completion, yet it has not, there is just enough of each side being made that the amounts of each doesn't seem to change. 

The Haber process was initially invented during world war 1, as the British blocked the Germans from getting their ammonia imported from Chile. As their ammonia source was blocked off, the German scientists had to discover a way to generate it themselves, or the Germans would eat through all of their stored crops. While the citizens were starving to death, Fritz Haber discovered the way to synthesise ammonia, which was then named the Haber Process. Haber discovered this mainly for fertiliser, but as Germany was a major party in the current war, they used the ammonia generated to help create German weaponry; explosives.

To source the hydrogen used, chemists use the process of natural gas reforming. Natural gas reforming takes many forms, some of which are steam methane reforming, or partial oxidization. For the nitrogen, the scientists split the gases in the air to extract the nitrogen from the air.

## Description of the optimal conditions for the synthesis of ammonia through the Haber Process
The Haber process involves 4 main conditions for optimal synthesis, those being the temperature of the system, the concentration of the different gases, the volume/pressure of the system, and the presence of a catalyst. The catalyst isn't required for the reaction to go ahead, however it increases the forward rate of reaction to generate a higher yield for the company performing the Haber process.
The ideal temperature falls within a range, often debated around which is the optimal exact value, the range being $400-450^oC$. 

The ideal pressure is around 200 atmospheres, however this is almost never used as it is very expensive to maintain at such a pressure. The pressure commonly used is closer to 2 atmospheres, as this is a more affordable/reasonably attainable pressure for constant reactions. 
An ideal graph of the haber process is attached below:

## Explanation of the effect of changing the temperature on the Haber process (including collision theory and Le Chatalier's Principle)

The temperature of a system has a major impact on whether a reaction favours moving to the left, or the right side of the equilibrium. As the Haber process is exothermic, $ΔH$ is negative, heat is given off on the forward side of the reaction. By adding temperature (heat) to the system, the reaction moves more towards the left side (reverse reaction), as by Le Chataliers principle the system will aim to minimise the effect of that change. To put it differently, to minimise the increase of heat, the system will move to the side that has less heat, which in the Haber process is the reverse reaction. 

Collision theory states that for a product to form, the particles of the reactants must collide. The more heat there is in a system, the more the particles within move. By increasing the heat within the system, chemists are able to increase the amount of collisions that occur within the reaction, which creates a better yield for the Haber process.

The graph below shows what would happen if the temperature of the Haber Bosch process is cooled, which looks good, right? If there is more ammonia, the process must be better? No, this is not the case. By increasing the temperature (the curves on the graph would be flipped, so H$_2$&N$_2$ would be going up, and $NH_3$ would be going down), the particles collide more, which leads to more overall forward reaction than decreasing the temperature would cause.

## Explanation of the effect of changing the concentration on the Haber process (including collision theory and Le Chatalier's Principle)
Changing the concentration within the system causes a different effect depending on which ingredient is changed. The below graph shows the change when more $N_2$ is added, which causes an immediate jump in the concentration of the nitrogen, which slowly decreases, alongside the $H_2$, to reach a new equilibrium point. As more of the left hand side of the reaction is added, the reaction moves more towards the right hand side, it only does this as there is less moles of gas on the right (1+3>1).  
![](https://dr282zn36sxxg.cloudfront.net/datastreams/f-d%3A58165e30628789ef52e2ee9d29f4c30200bf6b82deef9fec4323aba7%2BIMAGE_THUMB_POSTCARD%2BIMAGE_THUMB_POSTCARD.1)
Le chataliers principle states that an equilibrium reaction, when disturbed, will move towards the opposite side of the reaction to offset the change caused. By adding more $N_2$ or $H_2$, the reaction equilibrium will shift more towards the $NH_3$. This means that by adding more of the reactants, the chemists can increase the amount of products output from the Haber process. Furthermore, the same effect is explained by collision theory, describing that by adding more particles into a system, there will be more collisions, leading to more reactions, the same effect that le chataliers principle expects.
## Explanation of changing the volume and/or pressure on the Haber process (including collision theory and Le Chatalier's Principle)
Volume and pressure have an inversely proportional relationship. By increasing the pressure, the volume of the gases will decrease, and vice versa for the volume. By increasing the pressure in the Haber process, the system will move towards the side of the reaction that has the least moles of particles, which in this case, is the ammonia. By keeping a high pressure, scientists are able to force more ammonia to be generated, further increasing their profit margins.

Increasing the volume decreases the pressure, so for the Haber process scientists perform it in a very small reactor vessel. By decreasing the amount of space there is for the particles, the particles end up colliding more, which leads to more reactions occurring, which leads to more ammonia forming. 
In the figure below, there is a visual representation of how decreasing the volume (increasing the pressure) causes more reactions to occur, with there initially being more loose molecules, then eventually turning into more ammonia molecules (fig. C)
![](https://dr282zn36sxxg.cloudfront.net/datastreams/f-d%3Acc9559429cccc8969a516f5a203881f1d756b7f9446b82da4b23df46%2BIMAGE_THUMB_POSTCARD_TINY%2BIMAGE_THUMB_POSTCARD_TINY.1)
## Explanation of adding a catalyst on the Haber Process (including collision theory and Le Chataliers principle)
Adding a catalyst to almost any reaction increases the rate at which the reaction occurs. With the Haber Process, there is no violent change in how the reaction occurs, it simply increases the forwards rate of reaction (towards ammonia). This is beneficial for industrial use, as it allows teams to create more ammonia in a shorter time. 
With the Haber process, Iron can be used as a catalyst. Typically, the iron is sourced from a powder, which is obtained from reducing high-purity magnetite ($Fe_3O_4$). 
By adding a catalyst, chemists are able to create a reaction method that has a lower reaction energy, meaning that the reaction will generally move forwards more, when compared to a reaction with the same conditions without the catalyst.

The graph above demonstrates the reaction energy ($E_a$) required for a reaction with or without a catalyst. By adding a catalyst, it is clear how the reaction requires less energy to occur, leading to more of the products forming. 
As towards Le Chataliers principle, by creating an imbalance in the energy available in the reaction area, the reaction will move to balance the imbalance, which in this case is the ammonia (products) side of the reaction. For collision theory, there is less energy required for each collision to react, which means that many more collisions will cause reactions, leading to more reactions occurring, which means more ammonia forming.
