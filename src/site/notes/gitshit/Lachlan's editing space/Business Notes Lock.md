# Operations management:

- Responsible for acquiring the inputs and devising the best production methods so that the value adding occurs 
- The strategic role of operations management in business is to play a part in ensuring that the goals of the organisation are met.   
- Generally, business goals have to do with profit maximisation, which is achieved through maximising revenue and minimising costs. Expense minimisation.

Cost Leadership:

- Cost is how much the business pays for a good, price is how much the customer does
- Cost leadership is working towards being the lowest cost manufacturer in the industry

Can be achieved by different production technology, more efficient staffing etc. Cost leadership is only successful if a business is able to produce goods or services at the lowest possible cost whilst they are still acceptable to customers. By reducing costs of production and distribution, a business will be able to gain an advantage over competitors.

If the strategy is successful, the business will become the leading provider of a particular good or services based on their lowered costs. Businesses adopting a cost leadership strategy commonly have standardised products.(Kia is a good example). One company that can save themselves a lot of money for example is Startrack, checking their haul security so they don’t lose products ≈≈ money.

Input costs, Labour costs, processing costs, inventory costs, quality management costs.

Economies of scale are the cost advantages companies gain from increasing their output. For example, the same setup would be there for 1 unit AND 1 million units of a product.

Cost leadership at Qantas: they try to cut as many costs, in the main categories of staff, maintenance, fuel, and depreciation.

Qantas cost leadership:

- Economies of scale; the huge business means they have purchasing power when buying inputs such as fuel
- Strategic alliances; The OneWorld alliance means they can offer more routes without necessarily having to fly an actual plane there themselves
- They standardize product offering; by having fewer variations they can keep costs down, they recently reassessed and cut a bunch of routes to do this
- Technology; Cutting costs on HR through the use of online booking, tickets and check-in as well as more fuel efficient planes keeping fuel costs even lower
- Waste reduction; by using energy efficient devices, water saving measures and sustainable design, Qantas have saved money in their costs on electricity, water and waste removal

Product differentiation:

Distinguishing products (goods or services) in some way from its competitors. Different forms of differentiation include: the amount of time spent on a service, the level of expertise brought to a service, the qualifications and the experience of service providers, varying the quality of materials/technology used in service delivery.

Operations: Differentiating by industry category

- Operations function will look different in different businesses depending on their industry category
  
Quality expectations: understanding of a products ability to satisfy stated or implied needs. 

People have an inherent belief in what the quality standards should be for products and their personal level of satisfaction with their experience of the product will indicate whether the quality has met with these expectations or not.

# Influences

- Globalisation: the removal of barriers of trade between nations. It is characterised by an increasing integration between national economies and a high degree of transfer of capital, labour, intellectual capital and ideas, financial resources and technology.

Supply chain:

Where all the inputs are from

Global web: the network of suppliers a business has chosen on the basis of lowest overall cost, lowest risk and maximum certainty in quality and timing of supplies. A strategy in which the business aims to minimise cost across the range of its suppliers.

Sourcing: operations strategy that requires finding the suppliers needed so that production processes can be smooth flowing

Imitation: a business tends to create products similar to those that already exist, but will aim to do so at a lower cost

Reverse engineering: A process that involves a business taking the product of a competitor that has already been released into the market. This product is then taken apart to see how it is made. The imitating business then tries to make their own version of the product from the component parts, but does so using different materials and at a lower cost

How might globalisation impact aussie businesses?

  

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Positive|Negative|
|Increased potential customer base (global consumers)|More competition|
|Access to more options for manufacturing (cheaper labour, larger scale, different technologies)|Lower labour costs for competitors might make local efforts harder|
|Increased access to resources (natural resources, technology etc)|Restrictions/government influence isn’t equal everywhere (Aus might be disadvantaged)|
|Access to new ideas /inspiration for innovation and imitation|Australia relatively geographically isolated increasing costs comparative to other hubs|

The impact of globalisation on QANTAS:

Issues: Global web, sourcing, innovation/imitation, competition etc

Positive impacts: 

- Access to new customer markets
- Growth as a business
- Generate more returns for their shareholders
- Launch new services -> growth in asia
- New airlines launched eg jetstar japan
- Access to cheaper labour -> outsource their IT work to other countries etc
Negative impacts:
- Increased competition for Aussie customers choosing who to fly with
- Potentially losing revenue
- Creates an uneven playing field as 70% of the 40 airlines flying into Australia get government support from their home countries in ways Qantas doesn’t

Government influences: 
Taxation rates
Required materials handling practices
WHS standards
Training and rules
Public health policies
Environmental policies
Employment relations
Trade and industry policies

Legal regulation : following the law inside a business

Corporate social responsibility (CSR): Involves businesses doing more than just complying with the laws and regulations. Also known as the ‘triple bottom line’, CSR places value on financial returns as well as social responsibility and environmental sustainability

# Operations strategies
- Performance objectives: quality, speed, dependability, flexibility, customisation, cost
- New product or service design and development
- Supply chain management - logistics, e-commerce, global sourcing
- Outsourcing - advantages and disadvantages
- [Technology](Nov%2016,%202023#^140003)
## Quality management:
Quality management is the processes undertaken 
- Quality Control
Inspections carried out to make sure the process is meeting standards, management intervenes and corrects any mistakes in the process
- Quality Assurance
Measuring against standards at many levels of quality. 
- Quality Improvement

## Overcoming resistance to change - financial costs, purchasing new equipment, redundancy payments, retraining, reorganising plant layout, inertia
Change is a key influence on management ops, managing and being responsive about change may come with resistance or hesitation - therefore managers are strategic about it
Change can come from:
- Legislation
- Economic conditions
- Social expectations
- Technology
Change may require **major alterations to the way operations are undertaken**; people need to learn new skills, possibly lose jobs...

Resistance is either **financial** or **emotional/psychological**.
Financial costs:
- Purchasing new equipment
- Redundancy payments
- Retraining
	- Reorganisation of internal hierarchy, staff needing training etc
- Reorganising plant layout
Emotional/psychological:
- Inertia



## Global factors - global sourcing, economies of scale, scanning and learning, research and development
Global factors:
1. Pretty much all **businesses are influenced by global factors**, which in turn will impact their operations
2. Global operations can offer **cost-savings for operations managers** when they consider the most suitable sourcing options and advantages of locating their operations around the world.
3. Operations management that has been well set up, will allow **businesses to not just respond but be successful in the ever-changing international** business environment
### Global sourcing:
Refers to businesses purchasing supplies or services without being constrained by location. Global sourcing ensures that the outsourcing decision is made with consideration of the global market.

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| --- | --- |
| - Cost advantages<br/> - Access to new technology<br/> - Expertise and knowledge<br/> - Labour specialisations/skills<br/> - New resources<br/> - Longer hours of working | Possible need to relocate<br/> - Increased cost of logistics<br/> - Storage and distribution issues<br/> - Different national standards/regulations<br/> - Increased risk of fluctuations in foreign currency/exchange rates<br/> - Language and cultural variations |

Global factors at Qantas:

| **Factor** | **Looks like at Qantas** |
| -- | -- |
|Global sourcing|e.g. Asian cabin crews and pilots from NZ have been employed for some routes to take advantage of lower costs|
|Economies of scale|Outsourcing|
|Scanning & Learning|Stealing Qatar airways blueprints|
|Research & Development|Scientists developing biofuel|

# Glossary:

Quality: How well designed, made and functional goods are, and the degree of competence 

  

# Goofy writing space:

What is the relationship between quality and price?

When the price is higher for an item, a customer will expect it to be of higher quality. The same is noticed when a customer sees a lower price tag, they expect a lower quality product. An example of this is home brand items versus name brand products at a grocery store.

What would be the implications for a business that failed to meet quality expectations?

The business may lose customers, further leading into fewer sales. Once they have less sales, the business may be losing profitability, which damages the companies reputation.

What would be the implications for a business that successfully met quality expectations?

The company may keep/gain customers, which would lead into more sales, into more revenue, which would give them increased profits.

Need to adjust their schedules if they cannot deliver on time. Furthermore if Ops are unable to deliver some services they need to clearly communicate to Marketing so they don’t advertise something they cannot deliver on…


Questions:

1. Monitoring : supervising/keeping an eye on, watching
1. Control: to determine the behaviour of whatevers running
2. Improvement: the act of increasing the quality of a good or service
3. How would you monitor the performance of a retailer? Support your answer with reference to relevant examples
	1. I would look at their cashflow, determine what spending is required and what is unnecessary. Then, look into their customer
