**JOHN DOESN’T GET HUNG IN THE PLAY!!!**

What are the societal expectations within the setting of the witch trials/McCarthyism?

Did antagonists born bad, or did they become bad? (nature/nurture)

Dancing in the forest is only in film, it is just mentioned in the play

“There be no blush about my name” -> My name is good in the village! I will not have it said my name is soiled! - Abigail

Abigail, *in a temper*: My name is good in the village! I will not have it said my name is soiled! Goody Proctor is a gossiping liar!

Mary Warren: Abby, we’ve got to tell. Witchery’s a hangin’ error, a hangin’ like they done in Boston two year ago!

Betty: You did, you did! You drank a charm to kill John Proctor’s wife! You drank a charm to kill Goody Proctor!

I danced for the Devil; I saw him; I wrote in his book; I go back to Jesus; I kiss His hand. I saw Sarah Good with the Devil! I saw Goody Osburn with the Devil! I saw Bridget Bishop with the Devil!
