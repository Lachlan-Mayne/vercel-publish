# Welcome to obsidian!
The hardest part is installing it, smooth sailing from here on out. Firstly, ask me or Viz to make you a folder for all your notes, this will be **the only place where you should be editing with obsidian**. Obsidian doesn't currently support real-time editing accross devices, so if we all just work in our own folders, there won't be any issues to resolve. At the end of each week/term, we can collectively pool our notes into the ***main/root*** folder, and this will be done on only one persons device.

## How do I do $x$?
Start off by checking the [official obsidian documentation](https://help.obsidian.md/Home). If your question hasn't been answered, feel free to google your questions, and if that doesn't provide any helpful answers, come ask me or Viz.

# obsidian setup
install obsidian.md
install brew.sh
install github cli (``brew install gh``)
create directory
navigate to directory in terminal
run ``gh auth login``
git clone https://github.com/Lachlan-Mayne/obsidian-notes-2024.git
